```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pingdom

## Usage

### Checks

To get all checks

```ruby
checks = Pingdom::Check.all
checks.each do |check|
  puts check.name
  puts check.id
 end
```

To get one check using find, you need the id

```ruby
check = Pingom::Check.find 85975
# return a check or raise an error if the chech is not found
```

### Summary Outages

Get the Summary Outage by check id:

```ruby

summary_outage = Pingdom::SummaryOutage.find check_id

# With params from, to and order are not mandatory params

summary_outage = Pingdom::SummaryOutage.find check_id , from: 2.days.ago, to: 1.days.ago, order: 'ask'

# get up and down times
summary_outage.ups
=> 120

summary_outage.downs
=> 4

# get up and down times with min_interval to filter (in seconds)
summary_outage.ups min_interval: 300 # more than 5 minuts
=> 10
summary_outage.downs min_interval: 180 # more than 3 minutes
```
