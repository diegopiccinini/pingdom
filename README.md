```

- Or udate the client like:

```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pingdom'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pingdom

## Usage

To get all checks

```ruby
checks = Pingdom::Check.all
checks.each do |check|
  puts check.name
  puts check.id
 end
```

To get one check using find, you need the id

```ruby
check = Pingom::Check.find 85975
# return a check or raise an error if the chech is not found
```
